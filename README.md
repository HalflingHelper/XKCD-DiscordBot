## About
I wrote this bot in high school during the pandemic, soon after I first learned
about node.js. I learned the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) module and
figured out what `fetch` and API meant just barely enough to get a working bot
(see [this](https://github.com/HalflingHelper/XKCD-DiscordBot/tree/d5c0c56b8b7f5296d3daa20511fd5e4c92fa137f)
commit).

This summer, over 4 years later, it became a fun weekend project to look back at
and improve this questionable code, and see just how far I'd come in my 
understanding of node, the web, and programming style.
